                <p><i>A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team. <br>I am Shashank from Karnataka, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. <br> My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning programming languages from scratch.
                
                    I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.
                    
                    Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job. <br>Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.</i></p>
